# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

![COVID-19 Visualization Example](https://github.com/yourusername/covid19-tracker/raw/main/images/covid_viz.png)

## Project Description
A data analysis project that tracks global COVID-19 trends including cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and time. The project cleans and processes real-world data, performs exploratory analysis, generates insights, and visualizes trends using Python data tools.

## Objectives
- ✅ Import and clean COVID-19 global data
- ✅ Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
- ✅ Compare metrics across countries/regions
- ✅ Visualize trends with charts and maps
- ✅ Communicate findings in an interactive notebook

## Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Core Libraries**:
  - pandas (data manipulation)
  - NumPy (numerical operations)
  - matplotlib (basic visualizations)
  - seaborn (statistical visualizations)
- **Optional Advanced Libraries**:
  - Plotly Express (interactive visualizations)
  - geopandas (mapping capabilities)
- **Development Environment**:
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - VS Code with Jupyter extension

#  Key Insights
Vaccination Disparities: Developed nations achieved 50% vaccination coverage 3-5 months faster than developing countries

Case Fatality Rates: Varied significantly between countries (0.5%-3.5%) suggesting healthcare system impacts

Infection Waves: Most countries experienced 3-5 distinct waves correlating with variant emergence

Mask Mandate Impact: Countries with early mask policies saw 20-40% slower initial spread

Data Challenges: Underreporting was evident in regions with limited testing capacity
